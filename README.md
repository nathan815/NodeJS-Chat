NodeJS-Chat
===========

A simple chat application I made with Node.js and Socket.io.

## Why?

This started out with Socket.io's [basic chat application tutorial](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/).

I made this mainly just to try out and learn how to use Node.js and Socket.io, but anyone is welcome to use and improve this.

## Setup

Obviously, you'll need Node.js to use this. Get it from the [Node.js downloads page](http://nodejs.org/download/).

Follow these steps to setup and run the chat application on your computer:

1. Clone this repository and then go to the directory.
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/NathanCJohnson/NodeJS-Chat.git
    $ cd NodeJS-Chat
    ```

2. Use Node Package Manager (included with Node.js) to install the dependencies.
   ```
   $ npm install
   ```

3. Run the chat application server.
   ```
   $ node chat.js
   ```
   
If everything worked out properly, you should be able to access the chat application at `http://localhost:3000/`.
